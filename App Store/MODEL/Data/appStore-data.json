         "description":"Your iPhone can now feed you. No, your phone hasn’t learned to cook but you won’t have to either, thanks to the free, easy-to-use Eat24 Order Food Delivery & Takeout app.\n\nOrder food delivery from over 40,000 restaurants in 1,500+ cities, with more being added each day. Search 24 hours a day from wherever you are, or wherever you’re going to be when you’re ready for some food. The Eat24 app remembers your preferences, which saves you time, and gives you coupons on a regular basis, which saves you money. Oh, and because 24 is in our name, that means you can definitely order 24 appetizers for yourself and not feel the least bit bad about it. At least we're pretty sure that's how it works.\n\nWhat can our app do?\n- Search for specific cuisines, restaurants...even particular dishes.\n\n- It has Yelp inside. See what the foodies of Yelp think about a restaurant without leaving the app.\n\n- Eye Candy. Eat with your eyes and browse delicious food photos on the restaurant menu page. As if you weren’t hungry enough already.\n\n- In unfamiliar territory? Search by your current location, order, and the Eat24 app will have it waiting (well, really the restaurant will, but you get the idea).\n\n- Like to play favorites? We understand completely (Mom always liked us best). The Eat24 app lets you save your favorite restaurants so you can find them more easily next time.\n\n- Using filters to sort by distance, newest, top rated, delivery/pickup. Plus sort by personal preferences like spicy, healthy, and more. \n\n- Do you enjoy entering your credit card numbers over and over again? That’s a rhetorical question, no one does. Which is why the Eat24 app lets you scan your credit card directly into the app and securely stores your payment information for you.\n\n- Hate credit cards? Use Apple Pay or PayPal!\n\n- 24 Hour Live chat and order status support. If it isn’t right, we’ll make it right. No robots, no problem.\n\n- Cash back for future orders through our CashCoupon rewards system.\n\n- Exclusive offers and content through our Eat24Hours VIP program.\n\n- Eat24 Notes. Write a note about your meal right on your phone and remind yourself to order/not order an item again. (Because hunger affects memory in mysterious ways)\n\n- We added the popular Tweet My Meal function, because everyone knows that if you didn’t tweet about it, it didn’t actually happen.\n\nBest of all, once your order’s in, Eat24 handles every aspect of the delivery experience. Which means no more screwed-up orders. No more wondering where the delivery driver is. Just the ability to take back a few precious minutes of your day and enjoy. Something not quite right? Hit up our 24 Hours Live Support within the app and chat with a real human being about any issue or question you may have. We’ll make things right.\n\nTap, Relax and Enjoy with the Eat24 app in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington DC, Miami, Baltimore, Las Vegas, Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Diego, Houston, Denver, Atlanta, Phoenix, Austin, Philadelphia and almost every other U.S. city, with more being added every day",

Pacifica gives you psychologist-designed tools to address them based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness meditation, relaxation, and mood/health tracking.\n\nStress, anxiety, and depression are caused by an ongoing cycle of negative thoughts. Thoughts cause physical feelings and emotions which cause actions. Pacifica helps break this cycle using tools that target each of its components. Day-by-day, you'll learn to manage stress, anxiety and depression at your own pace. We’re not about quick-fixes or false promises. We are about real progress, a day at a time.\n\n#1 - BuzzFeed's Amazing Apps For Anyone Living With Anxiety\n#1 - Forbes' 4 Technologies Innovating in Mental Health\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\n\"This app is not only beautiful and easy to use, it's also an incredibly useful tool that has genuinely changed my way of thinking when it comes to anxiety.\"\n\n“Thank you so much for improving my quality of life.

Pacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to think in a more balanced way, which helps break the negative thought cycle.\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES & GOAL TRACKING\nPacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to face your anxiety, one day at a time, and gradually work toward your long term goals via daily challenges.\n\nHEALTH TRACKER\nSet and track daily health goals for habits that affect anxiety (exercise, sleep, caffeine, alcohol, etc.). Learn which of these trigger your anxiety based on patterns in your mood. Exercise, sleep and caffeine can also be populated using the Apple Health app.\n\nCOMMUNITIES & GROUPS\nYou aren’t alone in this. Share stories, advice and more with Pacifica’s peer-support community.\n\nPRICING & TERMS\nPacifica is free to download and use.

Established methods of self-help have been combined with high standards of usability to provide an engaging, flexible, and practical resource.\n\nThe key features of SAM are:\n\n• Clearly laid out menus\n• User guidance\n• External links\n• Self-monitoring of anxiety with graphical display\n• 25 self-help options covering: Information about anxiety, Thinking and anxiety, Physical relaxation, Mental relaxation, Health and Anxiety\n• Guidance on putting self-help into practice\n• Closed social network of SAM users\n\nThe content of SAM is presented in various media formats in order to support users in learning about anxiety and practicing self-help.

Users are encouraged to build their own Anxiety Toolkit of SAM resources that they find helpful and to draw on this for regular practice in managing situations that are associated with anxiety.   \n\nSAM may be used with or without the support of a registered health practitioner but you may wish to consult with your local health or well-being practitioner if you are uncertain about using SAM.",

         "description":"***** (5/5)  \"Word Wow is an explosion of thought-provoking, perplexing, and thrilling fun for almost all ages.\" - AppAdvice\n\nWord Wow is a word game where you make words to dig deeper into the ground. As you dig down, Worm will follow until you can guide him to the bottom before time runs out. You need to be able to make words quickly (although a no-timer mode is available) to string together bonuses, as well as just to clear the path.\n\nIf you find Worm to be stuck and you can't come up with any words, you can use a bomb to clear some of the tiles. You have a limited number of bombs, but you can earn more as you make more words. As Worm moves down the board, more letters become available.\n\nEach level has at least 1 hidden gem, and if you can find all the gems in all the levels of a world, a bonus level is opened where you can really rack up the points!\n\nThe bigger the words that you can make the more points you'll earn. Try and make enough points each level to earn all three stars.\n\nWord Wow will sharpen your brain as well as your reflexes.    Help a worm out! \n\nFeatures: \n* 140,000 word dictionary \n* Fast action with the timer or relaxed mode without it\n* 180 Levels and 9 distinct worlds \n* Bonus level for each world when  you collect all the gems\n* Lots of replay value as you try to compete with others in Game Center",

         "description":"This is the stop smoking app that science built. Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it’s done.\n\nWeekly Subscription\nIf you choose to subscribe you get access to all elements of the app. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the confirmation of purchase  and subscriptions automatically renew each week unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The subscription costs 99p (or local equivalent) per week. You can manage your subscriptions in the iPhone Settings app and you can turn off auto-renew by going to your Account Settings .Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchases a subscription, where applicable.

Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Spanish words, phrases and grammatical points with which you’ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Spanish, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience. \n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners of Latin American Spanish, MindSnacks is like your own personal Spanish teacher you can take just about anywhere .
